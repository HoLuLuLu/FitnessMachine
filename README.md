# Introduction

CITYSPORTS treadmills rely on the EQiSports app, which is objectively terrible.

Here are some reasons why:

- Can't pause and resume workouts
- Doesn't record workout history
- Won't push data to Apple Health
- Basically just a tech demo of the integration

This project aims to reverse engineer the bluetooth protocol used by these treadmills and then to create a better app that addresses these concerns.

# Protocol

The details of the protocol are [here](https://github.com/hughesjs/OpenEQiSports/protocol).

# New App

This section will be updated once it has been developed.
